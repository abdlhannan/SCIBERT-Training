A rechargeable battery comprising wherein the multiple tabs along the anode and cathode electrodes provide one level of internal resistance (R.sub.1) for operating the battery over a temperature range of the battery between a first temperature (T.sub.1) and a second temperature (T.sub.2), and the tabs at the opposing ends of said anode and cathode electrodes provide a second level of internal resistance (R.sub.2) for operating the battery outside of either T.sub.1 or T.sub.2, wherein the value of R.sub.2 at about 2.degree. C. below T.sub.1 is at least twice the value of R.sub.1 at T.sub.1 or the value of R.sub.2 at about 2.degree. C. above T.sub.2 is at least twice the value of R.sub.1 at T.sub.2.
