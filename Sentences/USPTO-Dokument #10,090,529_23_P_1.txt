A monolithic porous open-cell structure comprising a three-dimensional network of interconnected unit cells, the unit cells being bounded by a framework material, wherein the framework material is electrochemically oxidized or converted to the corresponding oxide or sulfide, the corresponding oxide or sulfide having interconnectivity windows for fluid flow between the unit cells, the monolithic porous open-cell structure having a void volume fraction of at least 25%, the unit cells have an average size in the range of about 10 nm to about 100 .mu.m, and an average aspect ratio in the range of about 1:1 to about 10:1.
