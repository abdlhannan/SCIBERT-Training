A method of manufacturing a battery electrode composition, comprising at least partially encasing each substrate backbone with a non-porous, continuous or substantially continuous active material film that includes the active material to form one or more composite material nanocomposites having a curved planar geometry, wherein the film has an average thickness on either side of the substrate backbone in the range of 1.4 nm to 200 nm, and wherein the active material stores metal ions within the film and is subject to volume changes greater than about 5% upon insertion or extraction of the metal ions
