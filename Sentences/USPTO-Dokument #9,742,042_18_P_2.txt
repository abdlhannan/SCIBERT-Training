A method of real-time assessment of capacity of both anode and cathode in a metal-ion battery, said method comprising providing a second voltage monitor connected between said cathode and said reference electrode, wherein a porous current collector is interposed between said reference electrode, on the one hand, and both of said anode and said cathode, on the other hand, to allow communication of metal ions (i) away from a metal-ion path between said cathode said anode and (ii) toward said reference electrode
