A method for forming an electrolyte composition including a solvo-ionic liquid, the method comprising combining a multidentate ethereal solvent with a salt mixture to produce a solvate, the salt mixture containing Mg(BH.sub.4).sub.2, and the solvate having a molar ratio of multidentate ethereal solvent to Mg(BH.sub.4).sub.2 within a range of 0.1:1 to 10:1, inclusive, wherein, due to the relative concentrations of the combined solvent and salt mixture, the solvate becomes the solvo-ionic liquid.
