An anode for a battery, comprising an electrochemically active material comprising a ternary alloy of tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), and antimony (Sb), the ternary alloy comprising a multiphase microstructure including an amorphous phase and nanocrystalline phase, each of the phases being ion active, the ternary alloy comprising SnxGeySbz, where x+y+z=100, and x.gtoreq.y or x.gtoreq.z, and the anode having a charge storage capacity that exceeds a rule of mixture capacity of individual elements tin (Sn), germanium (Ge), and antimony (Sb) comprising said anode.
