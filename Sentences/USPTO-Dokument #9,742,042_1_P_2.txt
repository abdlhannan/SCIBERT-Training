An apparatus for real-time monitoring of anode and cathode voltage, anode and cathode differential voltage, and anode and cathode state of charge in a metal-ion battery, wherein said apparatus is linked in operable communication with said battery, said apparatus comprising a second voltage monitor that is connectable between said cathode and said reference electrode, wherein a porous current collector is interposed between said reference electrode, on the one hand, and both of said anode and said cathode, on the other hand, to allow communication of metal ions (i) away from a metal-ion path between said cathode said anode and (ii) toward said reference electrode
