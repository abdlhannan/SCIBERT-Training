A method of preparing a solid ion conductor, the method comprising and sintering the precursor in an air atmosphere at a temperature from about 800.degree. C. to about 1250.degree. C. for about 2 to about 40 hours to prepare the solid ion conductor, wherein the solid ion conductor comprises a garnet oxide represented by Formula 4, wherein the precursor is a precursor of the solid ion conductor: Li.sub.5+x+2y(D.sub.y,La.sub.3-y)Zr.sub.2O.sub.12 wherein D is K, Rb, or Cs, and 0&lt
