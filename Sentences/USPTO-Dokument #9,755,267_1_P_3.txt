A method of manufacturing a cable-type secondary battery, comprising and helically winding a sheet-form outer electrode on an outer surface of the separation layer, wherein, before the step of helically winding, the method further comprises forming the outer electrode by applying a slurry containing an outer electrode active material on a surface of a sheet-form outer current collector to form an outer electrode active material layer.
