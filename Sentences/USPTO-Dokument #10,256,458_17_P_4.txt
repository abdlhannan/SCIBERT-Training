A method of manufacturing a battery electrode composition, comprising and aggregating the nanocomposites into a three-dimensional, electrically-interconnected agglomeration that includes internal pores between the nanocomposities that are left vacant and have a total porosity in the three-dimensional agglomeration that is defined by the curvatures of the nanocomposites of the plurality of electrically-interconnected nanocomposites so as to be sufficient to accommodate the volume changes in the active material that are greater than about 5% upon insertion or extraction of the metal.
