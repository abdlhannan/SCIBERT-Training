A process for the preparation of a monolithic porous open-cell structure, the process comprising forming a microparticulate mass to form a first template, the first template comprising a population of microparticles and interstitial volume between the microparticles within the mass, the surfaces of the microparticles within the first template having contacting surface regions that contact the surfaces of other microparticles within the mass and non-contacting surface regions bounding the interstitial volume, consolidating the microparticulate mass to form a second template wherein consolidating comprises compressing or sintering the microparticulate mass, infiltrating the second template with a framework material that coats the non-contacting surface regions of the microparticles, removing the second template to form a monolithic porous open-cell structure comprising a skeletal network comprising the framework material and having a void volume fraction of at least 25%
