A lithium ion battery, comprising and a transition metal cation trap comprising a siderophore, wherein the transition metal cation trap is tethered to a polymer to form a transition metal chelating polymer material which is deposited as a polymer coating layer onto i) one or more surfaces of any of the positive electrode or the negative electrode or ii) one or more surfaces of the microporous polymer separator, wherein the transition metal chelating polymer material traps and prevents migration of transition metal cations to and deposition thereof at or on the negative electrode, wherein the polymer is selected from the group consisting of polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyetheretherketones, polyethersulfones, polyimides, polyamide-imides, polyoxymethylene, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylenenaphthenate, polybutene, acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene copolymers, polystyrene copolymers, polymethylmethacrylate, polysiloxane polymers, polybenzimidazole, polybenzoxazole, polyphenylenes, polyarylene ether ketones, polyperfluorocyclobutanes, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylfluoride, liquid crystalline polymers, polyaramides, polyphenylene oxide, and combinations thereof, and the siderophore is a naturally occurring derivative of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.
