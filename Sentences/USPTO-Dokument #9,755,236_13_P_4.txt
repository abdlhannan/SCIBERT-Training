A process for producing a dendrite penetration-resistant layer for a rechargeable alkali metal battery layer, said process comprising and (d) applying a current or voltage to said working electrode and said counter electrode to induce an electrochemical oxidative decomposition and/or a reductive decomposition of said electrolyte for forming one or more lithium- or sodium-containing species that are chemically bonded to said multiple graphene sheets or platelets or exfoliated graphite flakes to produce said dendrite penetration-resistant layer.
