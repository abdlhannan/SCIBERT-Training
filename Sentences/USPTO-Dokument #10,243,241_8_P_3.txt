A method of forming a polymer coating layer within a lithium ion battery, the polymer coating layer comprising a transition metal chelating polymer material, the method comprising and depositing the transition metal chelating polymer material onto one or more surfaces of either of a positive electrode or a negative electrode of the lithium ion battery, or onto one or more surfaces of a microporous polymer separator of the lithium ion battery to form the polymer coating layer that traps the transition metal cations and reduces or prevents migration thereof, wherein the polymer is selected from the group consisting of polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyetheretherketones, polyethersulfones, polyimides, polyamide-imides, polyoxymethylene, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylenenaphthenate, polybutene, acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene copolymers, polystyrene copolymers, polymethylmethacrylate, polysiloxane polymers, polybenzimidazole, polybenzoxazole, polyphenylenes, polyarylene ether ketones, polyperfluorocyclobutanes, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylfluoride, liquid crystalline polymers, polyaramides, polyphenylene oxide, and combinations thereof, and the siderophore is a naturally occurring derivative of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid or is selected from the group consisting of bacillibactin, yersiniabactin, vibriobactin, azotobactin, ornibactin, and erythrobactin.
