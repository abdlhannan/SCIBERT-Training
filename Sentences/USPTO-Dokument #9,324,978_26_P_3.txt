A method for preparing a cable-type secondary battery, comprising (S3) surrounding the outer surface of the electrode assembly with the moisture-blocking layer so that one of the sealant polymer layers at a first end of the moisture-blocking layer and the other of the sealant polymer layers at a second end of the moisture-blocking layer are adhered at predetermined parts that overlap each other, such that the moisture-blocking layer is a tube form surrounding the electrode assembly
