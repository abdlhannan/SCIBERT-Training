An energy storage device based on atomic clusters including transition metal oxide rescaled by lithiation, comprising and transition metal nanoparticles dispersed thereon to be rescaled on the support by intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions, wherein divalent transition metal ion (M.sup.2+) of the transition metal nanoparticles is reversely changed to zero-valent transition metal state (M.sup.0) during lithiation and delithiation, and wherein the divalent transition metal ion reacts with atomic unit scale oxygen by lithiation, and is maintained on the scale of the atomic units when a duster returns to the transition metal oxide state while removing lithium in a M:LiO.sub.x core-shell structure, wherein the transition metal oxide is at least one selected from RuO.sub.2, IrO.sub.2, MnO.sub.2, Mn.sub.3O.sub.4, Co.sub.3O.sub.4, NiCo.sub.2O.sub.4, V.sub.2O.sub.5, SnO.sub.2, TiO.sub.2, MoO.sub.3, and Fe.sub.2O.sub.3.
