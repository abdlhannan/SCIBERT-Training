A battery electrode composition, comprising a composite material comprising one or more nanocomposites, wherein the one or more nanocomposites each have a curved planar geometry and comprise: a planar substrate backbone having a curved geometrical structure with a curvature that is selected based upon a volume expansion characteristic of the active material, and an active material forming a non-porous, continuous or substantially continuous film at least partially encasing the substrate backbone, wherein the film has an average thickness on either side of the substrate backbone in the range of 1.4 nm to 200 nm, and wherein the active material stores metal ions within the film and is subject to volume changes greater than about 5% upon insertion or extraction of the metal ions, wherein the one or more nanocomposites comprise a plurality of electrically-interconnected nanocomposites aggregated into a three-dimensional agglomeration, wherein the three-dimensional agglomeration comprises internal pores that are left vacant and have a total porosity in the three-dimensional agglomeration that is defined by the curvatures of the planar substrate backbones of the plurality of electrically-interconnected nanocomposites so as to be sufficient to accommodate the volume changes in the active material that are greater than about 5% upon insertion or extraction of the metal ions.
